				<p>My name is Valeriia Zarubina. I'm almost 26 y.o. and I was born and raised in Voronezh, which is the city in Russia. As we used to say: "It is a small town not so far from Moscow". Actually, we have much more than 1 000 000 citizens and it takes 6 hours by car from Moscow to us. As I can remember myself,I was always obsessed with travels and new cities, new countries. As I've visited quite a lot of, I've also made a list of Tips, that were very useful for me and maybe will be also useful for you, guys. Please enjoy!</p>
